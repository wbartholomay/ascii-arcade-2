## Motivation

ASCII Arcade was born from a love of classic board games and the elegance of terminal-based applications. In an age of complex GUIs and resource-heavy games, there's something refreshing about returning to the simplicity and accessibility of text-based interfaces. This project demonstrates that engaging, multiplayer gaming experiences don't require fancy graphicsâ€”just clever design, clean code, and a terminal.
